# Metro Memory

Did you ever wish your favourite metro map was now blank and you had to type all the stations from memory? Wish no more! This is what Metro Memory is for!

## Stack 

Metro Memory is a web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains all the source files.
  - **app/**: Next.js application logic.
  - **components/**: Reusable React components.
  - **hooks/**: Custom React hooks.

  - **lib/**: Utility functions and helper libraries.
  - **scripts/**: Build and deployment scripts.
  - **styles/**: Tailwind and custom CSS styles.
  - **types/**: TypeScript type declarations.


Inside `src/app/(game)` you will find the city-specific logic and data.

## Adding a new city

You can duplicate an existing city to see how the the data is structured. 
Hamburg is a good city to duplicate - for historical reasons, not all cities are structured the same, so this one is a good starting point. 


### Data 

A city needs the following: 
- `data/features.json` -> a GeoJSON FeatureCollection of Points, e.g. 
```
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [10.024136, 53.546112]
  },
  "properties": {
    "id": 161,
    "name": "Hammerbrook (City Süd)",
    "alternate_names": ["Hammerbrook"],
    "line": "HamburgSBahnS3",
    "order": 627
  },
  "id": 161
},
```
They reference the line ids. Alternate names are optional but helpful for fuzzy type matching. 

- `data/lines.json` -> a map of lineId to line data. 
- `data/routes.json` -> a GeoJSON FeatureCollection of LineStrings, referencing the lineIds. 

The files are typically generate from a source file, with a `preprocess.ts` script. 
This script is sometimes also responsible for giving ids to stations. 

*Warning: station ids must be stable so that existing players don't lose their locally-saved state. If you want to udpate some city's data, please ensure the existing ones are kept.*

### Configuration

Edit `config.ts` - The constant names should be self-explanatory. 

### Adding to the game

Add your city to `lib/citiesConfig.ts` and the relevant images.
